### Welcome to the InfluxDB configuration file.

# Once every 24 hours InfluxDB will report anonymous data to m.influxdb.com
# The data includes raft id (random 8 bytes), os, arch, version, and metadata.
# We don't track ip addresses of servers reporting. This is only used
# to track the number of instances running and the versions, which
# is very helpful for us.
# Change this option to true to disable reporting.
reporting-disabled = {{ influxdb_reporting_disabled | string | lower }}

# we'll try to get the hostname automatically, but if it the os returns something
# that isn't resolvable by other servers in the cluster, use this option to
# manually set the hostname
# hostname = "localhost"

###
### [meta]
###
### Controls the parameters for the Raft consensus group that stores metadata
### about the InfluxDB cluster.
###

[meta]
  # Where the metadata/raft database is stored
  dir = "{{ influxdb_metadata_dir }}"

  retention-autocreate = true

  # If log messages are printed for the meta service
  logging-enabled = true
  pprof-enabled = false

  # The default duration for leases.
  lease-duration = "1m0s"

###
### [data]
###
### Controls where the actual shard data for InfluxDB lives and how it is
### flushed from the WAL. "dir" may need to be changed to a suitable place
### for your system, but the WAL settings are an advanced configuration. The
### defaults should work for most systems.
###

[data]
  # Controls if this node holds time series data shards in the cluster
  enabled = {{ influxdb_data_enabled | string | lower }}

  dir = "{{ influxdb_data_dir }}"

  # These are the WAL settings for the storage engine >= 0.9.3
  wal-dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/wal"
  wal-logging-enabled = true
  data-logging-enabled = true

  # Whether queries should be logged before execution. Very useful for troubleshooting, but will
  # log any sensitive data contained within a query.
  query-log-enabled = {{ influxdb_querylog_enabled }}

  # Settings for the TSM engine

  # CacheMaxMemorySize is the maximum size a shard's cache can
  # reach before it starts rejecting writes.
  # cache-max-memory-size = 524288000

  # CacheSnapshotMemorySize is the size at which the engine will
  # snapshot the cache and write it to a TSM file, freeing up memory
  # cache-snapshot-memory-size = 26214400

  # CacheSnapshotWriteColdDuration is the length of time at
  # which the engine will snapshot the cache and write it to
  # a new TSM file if the shard hasn't received writes or deletes
  # cache-snapshot-write-cold-duration = "1h"

  # MinCompactionFileCount is the minimum number of TSM files
  # that need to exist before a compaction cycle will run
  # compact-min-file-count = 3

  # CompactFullWriteColdDuration is the duration at which the engine
  # will compact all TSM files in a shard if it hasn't received a
  # write or delete
  # compact-full-write-cold-duration = "24h"

  # MaxPointsPerBlock is the maximum number of points in an encoded
  # block in a TSM file. Larger numbers may yield better compression
  # but could incur a performance penalty when querying
  # max-points-per-block = 1000

###
### [cluster]
###
### Controls non-Raft cluster behavior, which generally includes how data is
### shared across shards.
###

###
### [shard-precreation]
###
### Controls the precreation of shards, so they are available before data arrives.
### Only shards that, after creation, will have both a start- and end-time in the
### future, will ever be created. Shards are never precreated that would be wholly
### or partially in the past.

[shard-precreation]
  enabled = {{ influxdb_shard_precreation_enabled | string | lower}}
  check-interval = "{{ influxdb_shard_precreation_check_interval }}"
  advance-period = "{{ influxdb_shard_precreation_advance_period }}"

###
### Controls the system self-monitoring, statistics and diagnostics.
###
### The internal database for monitoring data is created automatically if
### if it does not already exist. The target retention within this database
### is called 'monitor' and is also created with a retention period of 7 days
### and a replication factor of 1, if it does not exist. In all cases the
### this retention policy is configured as the default for the database.

[monitor]

  ### Each template line requires a template pattern.  It can have an optional
  ### filter before the template and separated by spaces.  It can also have optional extra
